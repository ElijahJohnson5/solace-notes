# Note App:
Very basic notes app that allows you to create, update and delete notes.


## Created Using the following
* SQLite
* Next JS 13
* Drizzle ORM
* Font awesome for the two icons
* Zod for validation
* Tailwind css for styling
* Daisy UI on top of Tailwind CSS



## Running the App

1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal and go to the directory where you cloned the repository
3. Run `yarn install`
4. Either run a dev server with `yarn dev` or run a prod server with `yarn build` and then `yarn start`
5. Open a web browser and go to `localhost:3000`
6. You should see the app and be able to create notes

## Future Improvements
* Make the UI look good on phones (it works on most screens besides phones)
* Convert to postgres instead of sqlite
* Add authentication so you can only access your notes
* Add unit tests
